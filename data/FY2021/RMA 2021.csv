11975,0022-53688 Rev 7,15,01/06/21,Applied Materials Inc.,Chawk,Workmanship,open,,,,,,"1/5/21: Parts are with burrs in holes per customer report. There are 15X parts returning for rework. Per the agreement between AMAT and Chawk, the manufacturing process still under trial and error method. Chawk tried to remove the hand deburring to cut down the cost per customer's request. Therefore, burrs are expected to remain in holes of part. AMAT was OK to let Chawk testing on the part to find a best manufacturing method for the part with less cost as much as possible. In addition, not all parts with burrs, but the customer returned them all anyway per the agreement.

QN40475706 - iOMS call for the installation of 3690-00908 x2, that particular screw is a M3
.8mm Pitch. The screw hole on the 0041-91826 is a M3 screw with a .5 pitch. This
cause the screw to cross thread as it is correctly installed via iOMS. The hole
on the 0041 needs to match the screw being installed. The part received was
REv02 but TC has an updated to Rev 03, both of these REVs call for the same M3
.5 hole which does not comply with 3690-00908. This might be able to be reworked
by MRB but a new part will be required to keep up production.
