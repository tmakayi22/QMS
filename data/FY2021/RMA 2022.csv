QN 40633171: Chem Manifold did not flow to the right output in Testing. It is supposed to reach a certain value, but fails to do so. Probably a functional issue of the part. 
Additions comments from the customer: The Chem manifold is installed on the HPC, CLNR. We do functional testing of the HPC on the CLNR and with this part installed we weren’t getting the correct water output reading on the Test fixture. It is supposed to reach the setpoint set and doesn’t reach the value desired. We got a new part and it worked fine. It might have been something with the part itself. It might have been damaged because nozzles are installed on the holes in the manifold and I think we installed the same nozzles on the different manifolds and it worked fine.
